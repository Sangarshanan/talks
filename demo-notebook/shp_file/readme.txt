---------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: updating from a previous version
---------------------------------------------

Since StatPlanet Plus v 3.0 the first column "GLOBAL" is no longer necessary in the data file (data.csv).
In addition, the column "YEAR" has been changed to "TIME".

StatPlanet Plus v 3.1 is compatible with previous versions of StatPlanet up to v 2.0.
StatPlanet data files from v 2.x and v 3.0 should therefore continue to work in v 3.1.

Copying your data and settings from a previous version of StatPlanet can now be automated.
However, it is important to make backups of your data before proceeding. Updating is done as follows:

1. Open the StatPlanet Data Editor in the new version of StatPlanet
2. Go to the 'Tools' Excel sheet.
3. Click on the button 'Copy data & settings into this file"
4. Select the file containing your data and settings and follow the on-screen instructions.

----------------------------------------------
  Instructions for creating your own map
----------------------------------------------

1. Before editing the data file, make sure you have extracted (unzipped) the files
2. Open "StatPlanet_data_editor.xls" to edit or import data
3. Excel macros need to be enabled to automatically import data
4. Select/unselect options for a simpler or more advanced interface (see also Excel sheet 'Settings')
5. After importing data, press the button 'Save data' (which saves to the file data.csv)
6. Click on StatPlanet.exe to see the results, or 'StatPlanet.html' in the folder 'Web' for the online version
7. Copy the contents of the directory 'Web' to your website to publish your map online
